A graphical item purchase and checkout system for small communities and groups.

This software was designed for several divisions of 40 trainees, totalling 1000. 

Its purpose was to replace the redundent and long-winded paper based system. The system was in place for purchasing small-goods such as drinks and snacks. The original system required the consumer to find their name on a huge spread sheet, and mark off the number of items purchased in the respective item fields. However, this was prone to error and theft. Also, it requried the supervising committee hours to tally up the purchases and calculate bills every fortnight.

The main screen of this software requires the user to scan their barcoded id-card to login. The user may then scan all the items they required using the barcode scanner in a POS-type system. Duplicate items stack, and the user is shown their current fortnightly bill aswell as their current cart cost, aswell as many other features. The user may then purchase the items quickly and easily.

The repo for the admin panel contains the software the comittee used to export all the required information about the fortnight into .CSV files, aswell as manage users, data, stock and much more.
